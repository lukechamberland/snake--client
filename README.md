# Snake Client Project

The Snake game is a highly popular video game that involves maneuvering a dot to consume food and increase in size. As the snake grows, it becomes an obstacle for smooth navigation. The objective of the game is to achieve the maximum possible size without colliding with the walls or itself, which would ultimately lead to the player's defeat.


This is simply a multiplayer version the genre.

To execute this client, you must first have the server-side running, which can be downloaded and installed from this location.
